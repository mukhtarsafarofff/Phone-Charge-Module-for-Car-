. Actually the MC34063 is the heart of many products that today need a DC-DC converter, that is, a direct voltage converter. The MC34063 is an extremely versatile electronic component that has gained wide acceptance in the electronics world. Its versatility is accompanied by a very convenient price which is an interesting combination. It is a switching regulator that, unlike linear regulators (such as the LM7805), does not dissipate much heat. In my case, my phone needs a charger at 5VDC, that is, the same voltage that a USB port provides us. Because of this, my faulty charger circuit was designed to provide such a voltage at a current of 500mA. With a few changes we can adapt the circuit I will discuss later to provide different voltages.
The chip used is basically the heart of a switched power supply (or switching regulator). That is, it is an oscillator that chops (or divides into portions) the input voltage, according to the required output voltage value.
